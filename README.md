# Diablo II: The Abyss
Diablo II: The Abyss is a mod I made for Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. When Diablo II came out in 2000, I was already a fan of the first game and was instantly hooked. Time and again, I come back to Diablo II. It’s one of those games you get a spontaneous urge to play a couple times a year. Now in 2010, its time for another D2 binge. This time, whenever I find myself thinking “Damn, it’d be cool if [cool idea] was in D2,” I add it. So far, this has taken the form of 50+ new runewords, several new skills, additional sockets in some items, and much more.
## Installation
(old)
1. Backup your original patch_d2.mpq and your character files (the Save folder in the game directory) just in case! Windows Vista/7 users: If you installed Diablo 2 in a non-public folder (i.e. Program Files) some of the files, especially the Save folder, will be found in %APPDATA%\Diablo II.
2. Run d2a_setup.exe
3. Run the game using the launcher setup placed in the Start Menu\Diablo II.
## Runes & Runewords
All these are in addition to the existing runes in Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction.
### Arcane Runes
These runes can be upgraded using the Horadric Cube. Combine 2 of the runes you wish to upgrade along with another rune in the same circle, and one sacred herb.
